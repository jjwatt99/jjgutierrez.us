My personal website is up at www.jjgutierrez.us

## About

I built my website using Angular, Python, Django, and MySQL. I deployed on AWS and I used Docker to make my code portable. I used Gunicorn to for my server and added NGINX as a reverse proxy and HTTP Cache. I did not include my Django settings file for security reasons.
